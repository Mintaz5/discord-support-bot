# Discord Support Bot
We needed a discord bot that would allow us to provide support more easily, without people needing to know who to contact with their specific issue.
Most ticket systems we looked at were either a bit outdated or we just didn't like how it handled interactions with user. This bot was created so we could customize it to our own liking.

## How it works
This bot utilizes popular "ticket system" and puts a little twist on it via interactions published by Discord API.
It makes discord guild support easier, as all requests can be categorized so proper support roles can be assigned. 
Also, all communication happens on separate channels so conversations are visible only to requestee and proper support members.

## Config
Even though the core of this bot cannot be changed easily, I provide locale and config files to make at least <b>some</b> changes easily.
If needed, you can translate strings and add new topics / assign different roles to proper support groups. Also, whole codebase is commented quite extensively.
